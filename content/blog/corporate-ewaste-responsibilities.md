For businesses in India, e-waste management is no longer just a "good to have" practice—it is a legal mandate. The E-Waste (Management) Rules lay out clear responsibilities for bulk consumers of electronics to ensure their e-waste is channeled to authorized recyclers.

### Key Responsibilities for Corporates

*   **Inventory Management:** Maintain records of E-Waste generated.
*   **Authorized Channels:** Ensure e-waste is only handed over to PCB-authorized recyclers or dismantlers.
*   **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):** If you are a producer, you have specific targets for collection and recycling.

### Benefits of Compliance

Adhering to these regulations protects your company from legal penalties and reputational damage. Moreover, adopting a green disposal policy enhances your Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) profile, demonstrating your commitment to sustainability to your stakeholders and customers.
